# SY Exercise

Exercise app with a master view containing a list of posts and a detail view containing a list of albums and their photos

Focus has been set on code and simplicity rather than on design, because it is easier to follow a design mock-up from a designer than to create clean code for complex features

Main libraries used are :
- Android architecture components for viewmodel
- Retrofit for API
- Room for DB
- Dagger for DI
- Picasso for image handling and caching
- AndroidX paging
- rxJava3 for reactive programming
